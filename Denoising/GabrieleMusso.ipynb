    "To create a Gaussian filter, we first apply the Gaussian formula including the required values of sigma and the size of our mask. This is implemented through the functions *gauss*, which returns the Gaussian function given sigma and x dimensions, and *createMask*, which returns the mask with the required values given the mask dimensions and sigma. At this point, the *gaussianFilter* function, which takes the image, mask size, and sigma as input, applies the filter through a 2D convolution.\n",

    "MRF Implementation for Denoising Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed MRF implementation uses convolution to search for the penalty associated with each pixel. This solution allows for the calculation of all pixel penalties in a single operation, reducing the need for loops. This operation is performed for all color intensities in the channel (in the case study, only grayscale) and returns a three-dimensional array with dimensions of 256 x height x width. For each pixel combination of a height and width position, we need to find the minimum value. A future implementation involves a C-written function to improve performance, as they are currently too dependent on double for loops.\n",
